# ChristianSwiftUI
Christian Software Swift UI version, developed for iOS devices. In our world, I think computer now becomes two populor platform, iOS and Android. Thus ios is the first platform, second is Android, so i created an  *Christian*  iOS version.
Also, our values and pursuits have not changed, like I said in https://github.com/lanhuaguizha/Christian.
> This app is for Christians to share personal feelings and seek satisfaction from the Word of God

> We are not going to show and perform, just to seek like-minded people, and we are able to seek joy and contentment from the Bible together. We also think it's the only way

> Finally, peace and peace will come from God, peace be upon you.
